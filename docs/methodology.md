   - Validate memory image integrity (hashes)
   - Identify OS and Volatility profile

2. **Initial Triage**
   - List processes and trees
   - List network connections
   - Review loaded modules and DLLs

3. **Deep Analysis**
   - Focus on suspicious processes
   - Extract memory artifacts
   - Look for injected code and hooks

4. **IOC Extraction**
   - Domains, IPs, hashes, file paths
   - Persistence mechanisms

5. **Reporting**
   - Timeline of activity
